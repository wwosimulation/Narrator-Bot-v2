    "description": "Every night you can bite a player by doing `+convert <player>` which will turn that player into a zombie at the end of the next night. Bitten players will remain in their team for one day before converting. All zombies can select different targets. Only players from the village team, the headhunter and the fool can be converted. Players who were converted to zombies will decay and die after three nights as a zombie. They will also die if they attempt to bite a werewolf. You win if all players have been converted. Your aura is **Unknown** and you belong to the **Zombie** team.",
